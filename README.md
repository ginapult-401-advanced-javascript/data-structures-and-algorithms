# challenge-05-linked-lists

## The challenge was to:
* create Node class with this.value and this.next properties
* create LinkedList class with a this.head property
* empty linked list created upon instantiation of LinkedList class
* define insert method that adds a node to the head of the list with O(1) time performance
* defined include method to check if a value exists returning true or false
* define a toString method to return a string representing all values in the linked list
* build passing testing for above functionality
* complete README

## Approach and Efficiency
* Approach I took: created methods and tested until passing
* Big O of space/time: O(n)

## API
* insert()
* includes()
* toString()
