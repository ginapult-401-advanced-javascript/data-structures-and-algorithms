# challenge-05-linked-lists

## The challenge was to:
* create Node class with this.value and this.next properties
* create LinkedList class with a this.head property
* empty linked list created upon instantiation of LinkedList class
* define insert method that adds a node to the head of the list with O(1) time performance
* define include method to check if a value exists returning true or false
* define a toString method to return a string representing all values in the linked list
* build passing testing for above functionality
* complete README

## Approach and Efficiency
* Approach I took: created methods and tested until passing
* Big O of space/time: O(n)

## API
* insert()
* includes()
* toString()

# challenge-06-ll-insertions

## The challenge was to:
* define an append method to add a new node to the end of a list
* define an insertBefore method to add a new node immediately before a given value
* define an insertAfter method to add a new node with the new value immediately after the given value
* build passing testing for above functionality
* complete README

## Approach and Efficiency
* Approach I took: created methods and tested until passing
* Big O of space/time: O(n)

## API
* append()
* insertBefore()
* insertAfter()

# challenge-08-kth-value-from-end

## The challenge was to:
* write a method that takes a number (k) as a parameter and returns the node's value that is "k" from the end of the linked list
